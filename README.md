Network for Change Detection. The pytorch implementation for "[SNUNet-CD: A Densely Connected Siamese Network for Change Detection of VHR Images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9355573) ". For details, please see [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_42392454/article/details/121557001?spm=1001.2014.3001.5501).

## Quick start

1. clone this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Runist/Siam-NestedUNet
```
2. You need to install some dependency package.

```shell
cd Siam-NestedUNet
pip installl -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the change detection dataset. You can find the dataset  in this [repository](https://github.com/likyoo/Siam-NestedUNet#dataset).
4. Configure the parameters in [utils/parser.py](https://github.com/Runist/Siam-NestedUNet/blob/master/utils/parser.py).
5. Start train your model.

```shell
python train.py
```
6. Open tensorboard to watch training process.

```shell
tensorboard --logdir ./weights/tutorial/log/
```

7. You can run *evaluate.py* to watch model performance.

```shell
python evaluate.py
```
8. Get prediction of model.

```shell
python inference.py
```
